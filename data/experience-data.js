        This project is a <b>Server-Side Rendering (SSR)</b> website using the
        Next js framework.
        <br />
        In this project, we try to use the ability of SSR in Next js for
        creating dynamic sections based on what the dealership wants to show to
        people and their customers. Dynamic parts of this project come from our
        back-end that uses <b>Node js and Express</b> framework for the{" "}
        <b>back-end</b> server and <b>MySQL</b> for the database. With this
        config, we can use this project as a Template for other dealerships that
        like this design for their website and do not require massive changes in
        the front-end, just creating a table in the database for them and
        putting their information in that.

        Bonte takeaway is a Caffe in shiraz that 5 of my friends established. I
        tried to help them share their menu with customers in an easy way.
        <br />
        This website is generated with <b>React js</b> framework and the
        challenging part of this project was handling the menu images to get
        from a <b>CDN (Cloudinary)</b> and display it on their site.
        <br />
        <b>
          This was a good experience for me because I learned how CDNs works and
          how we can use them in our projects
